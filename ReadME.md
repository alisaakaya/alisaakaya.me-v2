2. Edit `index.html` — update your **name, projects, skills, experience, and contact info**.
3. Drop your PDF resume into the `assets/` folder and update the nav link if needed.
4. Deploy to Netlify:
   - **Drag & Drop:** Go to [Netlify → Add New Site → Deploy manually](https://app.netlify.com/start), drag your folder.
